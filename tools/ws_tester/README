			Run queries against a web service
			=================================

Ws_tester.pl is a simple perl script to test queries against an HTTP-based web service, such as any of the OGC web services.


Example usage of ws_tester.pl
-----------------------------

The following command:

	./ws_tester.pl http://pdcdev:8080/52nSOSv3.5.0/sos caps_query.xml

will run the query contained in the given xml file (caps_query.xml) against the web service located at the given URL (http://pdcdev:8080/52nSOSv3.5.0/sos).  The query is read in from the file, sent to the web service via HTTP POST, & the query response is then written to stdout.
