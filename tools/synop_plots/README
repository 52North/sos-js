			Produce plots of BAS synop data
			===============================

Synop_plots.R is a simple R script to produce a set of plots of BAS meteorological synoptic data.  The script takes a number of command line arguments (see example usage below) which are used to query the BAS SOS instance.  The returned data are then used to produce the plots.

Running this script without any arguments will output its formal usage message, as follows:

	Usage: synop_plots.R /path/to/output/dir offeringID propertyID year


Example usage of synop_plots.R
------------------------------

The following command:

	./synop_plots.R ./plots HalleySynop air_temperature 2012

will query the SOS for all air temperature data, for 2012, from the Halley synops.  The resultant plots will be deposited in the specified directory (./plots).
