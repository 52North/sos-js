			Custom build 3rd party tools directory
			======================================

This is a directory for collecting together custom builds of 3rd party libraries, tools etc., required by the SOS libraries.

The OpenLayers library was rebuilt (i.e. minified) to include our mods. to OpenLayers/lib/OpenLayers/Format/SOSGetFeatureOfInterest.js (see "Modified by" comment around line 151).

Added a Proj4js definition for EPSG3031 - Polar Stereographic, required for Antarctica, into the defs directory as proj4js/lib/defs/EPSG3031.js.

The proxy.cgi script (from the OpenLayers distribution) has been modified to only allow connections to pdcdev:8080 & localhost:8080.  This should be installed into the cgi-bin directory of the web server that hosts the SOS js library.

We include an additional "plugin" to the standard flot distribution (jquery.flot.axislabels.js) for plot axis labels.  The yui-compressor (see below) was used to minify this plugin, as per the standard flot distribution.

Under the yui directory is the yuicompressor java library & a simple shell script wrapper (yui-compressor) to make it easy to call the library.  The yui-compressor is a javascript code minifier, which should be installed locally as /usr/local/bin/yui-compressor, with the library directory installed as /usr/local/lib/yuicompressor/.  This then allows minification of any javascript code.
