      <!-- A column is required for each column of data that will be inserted into the SOS database. You may specify additional
      columns here as well. Any columns you wish to include within SOS must have the "include='1'" attribute set.
      "num" - The sequential number of this column, starting with 0 for the left-most column. This is to ensure columns are always 
      processed in the correct order. This attribute is required.
      "unit" - The unit of measure for this phenomenon. Most units of measure are taken from the Unified Code for Units of Measure, 
      found at http://unitsofmeasure.org.
      "type" - Determines what kind of value can be found in this column. Only numeric or text are allowed values. This attribute must 
      be set if the include attribute is set to 1.
      "sensor" - The ID of the sensor from which this measurement is made. 

      Date and time formats are handled differently. If a column contains date/time information in the ISO format (%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S), 
      then the name of that column must be "observation_time." If a column contains date/time information in UNIX timestamp (seconds 
      since 1970-01-01), then the name of that column must be timestamp. Additionally, there are special "reserved" phenomenon names you 
      can use to construct the observation date/time. This is particularly useful if the date/time components of an observation are in 
      separate columns. These reserved names are year, month, monthday, yearday, hour, minute and second. If you use any of these special 
      names, in lieu of either observation_time or timestamp, the script will attempt to calculate the timestamp based on the date/time 
      components it finds. -->
